# QuoteShare

QUOTESHARE - A platform to save and share your favourite book/film/inspirational quotes.
Try it out [here](https://quoteshareapp.herokuapp.com/).

### Brief

General Assembly WDI Project 2. Using the Sinatra micro-framework, build a full-stack, database backed application of your choice.

### Problem

After writing down interesting passages I had come across while reading books and online articles, I had accrued a messy list of quotes that was becoming more difficult to search through. This led to the idea for an application that could not only allow you to easily navigate through your own database of quotes, but also for you to explore others' favourite quotes.

### Solution

QuoteShare is CRUD application for users to store and share their favourite quotes.

Users can search other members' quotes on QuoteShare by content, author or subject, upvote and save them to their personal Favourites list. Users can also add their own quotes to the platform.

The Home Page also has a 'Top 5 Quotes' feature displaying the most popular quotes on the site.

Techs used: Ruby, Sinatra, PostgreSQL, HMTL/CSS.
